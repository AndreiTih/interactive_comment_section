### Interactive comment section
An implementation of a comment section design provided by [frontendmentor](https://frontendmentor.io).

The backend is written using node.js.

### Left to implement
- The upvote functionality.
- Refactoring the backend-side to use a framework such as express or fastify instead of the http module.

### Running the code

Run the command ```node server.js``` in the root of this repo to start the server.

### Database setup
Platform: Windows

I'm using MySQL Community Server - GPL, version 8.0.36.

server.js will assume this computer has a MySql server running for user = "root" with password = "qweasd123" on localhost:3306.

These details can be changed in db_config.json.

### Installing MySql

If you're on windows, download the installer from: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/ and follow the instructions provided.
